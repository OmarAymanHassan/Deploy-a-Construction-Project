commercial renovation 

Project ID: LA-CR-0426-MX
Location: Downtown Los Angeles
Building Type: Mixeduse commercial (offices, retail)
Building Age: 28 years (last renovation 2009)

1  Overview 

Mid size but operationally sensitive commercial renovation of an occupied mixed  use building in downtown Los Angeles  The building must remain partially operational throughout construction, with tenants present on floors 2 and 4 during weekdays 

The renovation scope includes core MEP upgrades, interior modernization, and selective structural reinforcement, with strong emphasis on safety, regulatory compliance, and schedule reliability 

While cost matters, delivery risk and operational disruption are higher  priority concerns 

2  Scope of Work
Mandatory Inclusions

Electrical rewiring (legacy copper , partial aluminum)

HVAC system upgrade (central , floor  level units)

Interior redesign (lobby, common areas, 3 office floors)

Conditional / Ambiguous Items

Fire suppression system upgrade (required if electrical scope triggers code review)

Seismic bracing (recommended, not explicitly mandated)

Smart building sensors (nice  to  have, budget dependent)

Note: Some historical blueprints are missing or outdated 

3  Constraints & Preferences (Conflicting by Design)
Budget

Target budget: $1 2M

Acceptable overrun: up to ,8% if risk reduction is demonstrable

Hard stop above $1 35M unless scope reduction justified

Timeline

Target completion: 6 months

Acceptable extension: ,2 weeks

Penalties apply for delays beyond that

Operational Constraints

No full  day power shutdowns on weekdays

Noise  intensive work restricted to weekends and nights

HVAC downtime must be staged floor  by  floor

4  Regulatory & Compliance Considerations

Must comply with California Title 24

City permits required; approval timelines historically unpredictable

Building has prior minor OSHA citation (resolved, but reputational sensitivity)

5  Contractor Requirements (Implicit , Explicit)
Explicit

Proven US commercial renovation experience

Ability to manage multi  phase, occupied  building projects

Strong safety record

Implicit / Soft Signals

Familiarity with LA city permitting processes

Local subcontractor network preferred

History of handling legacy electrical systems is a plus

6  Bid Evaluation Guidance (Non  Numeric, Subjective)

We are not simply selecting the cheapest or fastest bid 

Decision should consider:

Scope completeness vs hidden exclusions

Realism of timelines vs confidence levels

Risk introduced by subcontracting critical paths

Evidence of similar past projects

External reputation and delivery history

We are willing to accept:

Slightly higher cost

Slightly longer timelines

If and only if risk and disruption are demonstrably lower 

7  Known Risks & Ambiguities (Buried Signals)

One prior renovation experienced a 6  week delay due to permit revisions

Electrical infrastructure condition worse than documented

One tenant is planning a lease renewal contingent on minimal disruption

Insurance provider has flagged construction risk as “moderate  high”
